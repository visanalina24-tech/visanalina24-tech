 Hi there 👋
 My name is Alina and I'm 20 years old, from Bucharest.
 
 Currently, I'm student at Bucharest University of Economic Studies and my passion is about technology and problem solving. I know I'm at the beginning of my adventure but I'm eager to learn and contribute through opportunities. 🚀
 
 I've done various projects through programming languages like Oracle SQL/PL, MySQL, C++, which are linked down below, and more projects are comming.😊
 
 I've been using tools like: Microsoft Visual Studio Code 2022, Visual Studio Code, Code::Blocks, Oracle Apex, SQLDeveloper.
 I also have knowledge about Computer/Laptop Hardware Basics, earned through CISCO Courses but also by building my own PC.😊
 
 Feel welcome to reach me by email or by my LinkedIn profile.😊
